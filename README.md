#Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Assignment
==============================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in Coursera. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data was actually downloaded from URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
This data was uncompressed and placed in a folder with original folder structure and file name remaining the same.

## Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file. The code assumes that the data will be available at a certain location. If you want to run this code you may have to change the location and point it to location on your pc.

`AveragesData.txt` is the output generated by the program.
